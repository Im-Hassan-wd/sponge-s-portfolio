## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Im-Hassan-wd/sponge-s-portfolio/master/img/porfolio.PNG)

I created my personal porfolio:

1. Constucted a wire-frame,
2. designed it using figma and
3. later turned it to a pixel-pefect web page.

- You can find my demo in link in [contact section](#contact)
- I got to work more on my grid experience
- Creating this page have helped my css grid, grid-rows and grid-column
- Your wisdom? I control the web with my mind :)
